    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the VLM Lab! In this hands-on exercise, you'll explore the fascinating world of Visual Language Models - AI systems that can understand and reason about both images and text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand VLMs and Their Architectures**: Explain how VLMs work and differentiate between major architectural approaches (CLIP, BLIP, LLaVA)\n",
    "2. **Understand Applications of VLMs**: Identify and implement practical applications like image search, captioning, and visual question answering\n",
    "3. **Evaluate and Apply**: Analyze trade-offs between different VLM approaches and make informed decisions for real-world problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Paths Available\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides **two implementation paths** based on your available compute resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🚀 Path A (Limited Compute)**: Uses CLIP and smaller models - runs on CPU or basic GPU\n",
    "- **⚡ Path B (More Resources)**: Uses BLIP-2 and larger models - requires GPU with 8GB+ VRAM\n",
    "\n",
    "**You only need to complete ONE path**, but you're welcome to explore both!\n",

    "### 🤖 Using AI Assistants Effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are encouraged to use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) for coding help!** However, use them wisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Good uses:**\n",

    "Checking GPU availability lets the notebook choose the right device (CUDA GPU vs. CPU) for tensor operations. VLMs rely on large matrix multiplications and attention computations over high‑dimensional tensors; GPUs are optimized for massively parallel math and high memory bandwidth, so inference/training is typically much faster. On CPU, these same operations run with far less parallelism and lower throughput, which can make model loading and generation/classification noticeably slow.\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Question 1: The Alignment Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we discussed the \"alignment problem\" - the challenge of creating a shared representation space where visual and textual concepts are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Why is it challenging to align vision and language? Think about:\n",
    "- How images and text are fundamentally different\n",
    "- What makes the word \"cat\" similar to a picture of a cat in a meaningful way\n",
    "- What information might be lost or gained when converting each modality to embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "Aligning vision and language is difficult because images and text encode meaning in fundamentally different ways. Images are continuous, high‑dimensional signals with spatial structure (multiple objects, attributes, and relationships), while text is discrete and sequential, often describing only part of what is visible and at varying levels of specificity. To make the word “cat” land near a picture of a cat, the model must learn robust correspondences across many visual variations (pose, lighting, background, breed) and many textual phrasings (synonyms, context). Paired data can be noisy or ambiguous, and compressing both modalities into fixed-length embeddings inevitably loses some detail (e.g., exact counts or small text), so the model must preserve shared semantics while becoming invariant to irrelevant pixel-level differences.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: What does \"zero-shot\" mean in the context of CLIP? Why is this capability valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "Zero-shot in CLIP means it can classify or retrieve using new labels without training on labeled examples for that specific task. You provide candidate labels as text prompts, CLIP embeds both the image and the prompts, and it selects the closest match in the shared embedding space. This is valuable because it reduces the need for task-specific labeling and lets you adapt quickly to new categories (open-vocabulary classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: Look at the classification results above. Try modifying the `categories` list to test different classifications. What happens if you make the categories more specific (e.g., \"a golden retriever\" vs \"a photo of a dog\")?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Observations**:\n",
    "Making prompts more specific often shifts the ranking and can improve accuracy because it reduces ambiguity and better matches CLIP’s training distribution. Prompts like “a photo of a golden retriever” or adding context (photo vs. painting, indoor vs. outdoor) frequently increase the similarity for the correct concept compared to generic prompts like “dog.”\n",

    "\n",
    "Look at the search results for different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**:\n",
    "1. How well did CLIP perform on these searches? Were the top results relevant?\n",
    "2. Try creating your own search queries in the code above. What types of queries work well vs. poorly?\n",
    "3. Why might some queries be harder for CLIP than others? Think about:\n",
    "   - Abstract concepts vs. concrete objects\n",
    "   - Relationships between objects\n",
    "   - Fine-grained details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Analysis**:\n",
    "CLIP search is usually strong for concrete, visually distinctive objects (“dog,” “bus,” “pizza”) and common scenes because these concepts are well represented in training data. The top results are often relevant, though you may see near-misses when multiple objects co-occur or when the query is ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries that work well: concrete nouns, common activities (“a person riding a bicycle”), and simple attributes (“a red car”). Queries that work poorly: abstract concepts (“freedom”), subtle relationships (“the person holding the smallest object”), and fine-grained distinctions (specific brands, exact counts, small text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some queries are harder because CLIP embeddings capture broad semantic similarity more than precise spatial reasoning. Abstract concepts are not directly observable, relationships require structured reasoning about multiple entities, and fine-grained details may be too small or underrepresented to be reliably encoded in the joint embedding space.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: What is an embedding, and why do we need them? (Hint: Think about how computers represent things)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "An embedding is a learned numeric vector that represents an input (image or text) so that semantic similarity corresponds to geometric similarity. We use embeddings because computers operate on numbers; embeddings turn complex inputs into fixed-length vectors that can be compared efficiently (for retrieval, clustering, and classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: Look at the similarity matrix above. What does a high similarity score (bright color) tell you about the relationship between an image and a text description?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "A higher value indicates the model thinks the image and that text description are more semantically aligned in the joint embedding space (i.e., the text better matches what’s in the image). A lower value suggests a weaker match or that other descriptions fit the image better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**: CLIP uses **cosine similarity** (measuring the angle between vectors) rather than Euclidean distance. Why might angle be a better measure than distance for semantic similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "Cosine similarity compares direction rather than magnitude, which is helpful because embedding length can vary for reasons unrelated to meaning (scale, normalization, etc.). Direction tends to encode the “concept,” so angle-based similarity is often more stable for semantic matching than raw distance.\n",

    "**Your Analysis**:\n",
    "VQA tends to work best on questions that are close to object detection/recognition (“What is in the image?”, “What animal is shown?”) and some straightforward attribute questions (colors, common actions), because these align with strong visual cues.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 🤔 Reflection Question 3: Fine-Tuning Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, think about this scenario:\n",

    "**Scenario**: A hospital wants to use a VLM to help radiologists by automatically generating descriptions of X-ray images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "1. Would a pre-trained model like BLIP (trained on general internet images) work well out-of-the-box? Why or why not?\n",

    "3. What kind of data would you need? How much?\n",
    "4. What are the ethical considerations? (Think back to the lecture on VLM limitations)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "1) A general pre-trained model would likely perform poorly out-of-the-box because medical X-rays differ substantially from internet photos (domain shift) and the required language (radiology terminology, clinically relevant findings) is specialized.\n",
    "2) Fine-tuning challenges include limited labeled data, strict privacy/compliance requirements (HIPAA), high stakes for errors, class imbalance (rare findings), and the need for careful evaluation and calibration to avoid hallucinated findings.\n",
    "3) You would need paired X-ray images and high-quality ground-truth reports/labels (radiologist-verified). Practically, you often need at least many thousands of studies (and ideally tens of thousands+) depending on scope and label granularity, plus a clean validation/test set.\n",
    "4) Ethical considerations: patient privacy and consent, bias across populations and equipment, risk of automation bias (clinicians over-trusting outputs), explainability/auditability, and clear human oversight—outputs should be assistive and reviewed by qualified clinicians, not treated as autonomous diagnoses.\n",

    "4. What are the risks of a model training on its own outputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "1) Data quality matters because the model will learn whatever patterns the data contains—good or bad. High-quality, well-aligned image–text pairs teach the model correct associations; noisy captions/labels teach incorrect ones.\n",
    "2) Low-quality or biased data can cause systematic errors (hallucinations, spurious correlations), amplify demographic biases, and reduce generalization, leading to unreliable or unfair outputs in deployment.\n",
    "3) Bootstrapping can help by generating candidate captions, filtering them using quality checks (e.g., consistency, confidence, human review), and retraining on the cleaner subset—effectively denoising and expanding training data.\n",
    "4) Risks of training on its own outputs include feedback loops that reinforce mistakes, amplify biases, reduce diversity in language, and “model collapse” where the system learns increasingly generic or incorrect patterns because the errors become part of the training signal.\n",

    "**Question 1**: Why do we use different metrics for retrieval (Recall@K) vs. generation (BLEU)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "Retrieval is a ranking problem, so metrics like Recall@K evaluate whether relevant items appear near the top of the returned list. Generation has many valid wordings, so overlap-based text metrics like BLEU estimate how close the generated text is to reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: What are the limitations of automatic metrics like BLEU? Can a caption have a low BLEU score but still be good? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "BLEU (and similar automatic metrics) can penalize correct paraphrases and synonyms because they reward exact n-gram overlap. Example: reference “a man riding a bike” vs. prediction “a person on a bicycle”—semantically correct, but BLEU may be low due to different wording.\n",

    "**Question 3**: From the lecture, we learned about human evaluation. Why is human evaluation still important despite having automatic metrics?\n",

    "**Question**:\n",
    "1. Why are hallucinations particularly problematic for VLMs in high-stakes applications (medical, legal, safety)?\n",
    "2. The lecture mentioned that \"confidence doesn't correlate with accuracy.\" What does this mean, and why is it dangerous?\n",
    "3. How would you design a system to detect or mitigate hallucinations in production?\n",
    "4. What responsibility do AI developers have to communicate these limitations to users?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "1) In high-stakes settings, a confident but wrong answer can cause real harm (misdiagnosis, wrongful legal conclusions, safety incidents). VLM hallucinations are especially dangerous because outputs can sound authoritative even when unsupported by the image.\n",
    "2) “Confidence doesn’t correlate with accuracy” means the model’s tone/probability-like wording is not a reliable indicator of correctness. This is dangerous because users may over-trust fluent answers and skip verification.\n",
    "3) Mitigations: force grounding in approved sources (RAG over curated databases), implement abstention/deferral policies, add verification checks (consistency prompts, cross-model agreement, rule-based constraints for counts/units), log and review failures, and route uncertain/high-risk cases to humans.\n",
    "4) Developers must communicate limitations clearly (UI warnings, documentation, known failure modes), design for safe use (human-in-the-loop), and avoid deploying the system where the expected harms outweigh benefits.\n",

    "- Point their camera at any exhibit\n",
    "- Get a detailed description\n",
    "- Ask questions about the artwork\n",
    "- Hear stories and historical context\n",

    "4. What evaluation metrics matter for this use case?\n",
    "5. What could go wrong? How would you mitigate risks?\n",
    "6. How would you ensure accessibility and inclusivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Design**:\n",
    "**1) Architecture**: Use a hybrid approach:\n",
    "- **Recognition/Retrieval layer**: CLIP-style image embeddings to identify the exhibit (nearest-neighbor search) and pull curated metadata quickly.\n",
    "- **Conversational layer**: a multimodal instruction-tuned model (LLaVA-style / multimodal LLM) that answers questions and generates narratives, grounded via **RAG** over the museum’s approved catalog (artist, date, medium, provenance, curator notes, audio scripts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) API vs. self-hosted**: Hybrid deployment.\n",
    "- **Self-host** the embedding index + lightweight vision model for fast, predictable exhibit identification.\n",
    "- Use an **API** (or a centrally hosted multimodal LLM) for dialogue and storytelling to reduce ops burden and enable rapid iteration. If network/privacy constraints require it, host the LLM on museum-managed infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Data needed / acquisition**:\n",
    "- High-quality images of each exhibit (multiple angles/lighting), plus a structured catalog (title, artist, year, medium, location).\n",
    "- Curator-approved descriptions, stories, and FAQs; multilingual versions; accessibility scripts.\n",
    "- Collect from the museum CMS/archives, digitization workflows, and curated Q&A written by staff; verify rights/permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Evaluation metrics**:\n",
    "- **Retrieval**: Recall@1/5 for correct exhibit identification; latency and failure rate.\n",
    "- **Q&A/storytelling**: factuality/grounding rate (human review + spot checks), user satisfaction, engagement (time in experience), and safety incidents.\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: comprehension ratings, screen-reader compatibility, and user feedback from diverse audiences.\n",

    "**5) Risks / mitigations**:\n",
    "- Hallucinated facts → enforce RAG grounding, show citations (“From the museum catalog”), and allow abstention/escalation.\n",
    "- Misidentification → confidence thresholds + “Did you mean…” alternatives and manual search fallback.\n",
    "- Privacy (visitor faces) → process on-device when possible, avoid storing raw images, and minimize logging.\n",

    "**Your Analysis**:\n",
    "**CLIP (Path A) vs. BLIP (Path B): key trade-offs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CLIP limitations vs. generative models**: CLIP does not natively generate language or handle open-ended Q&A; it mainly scores similarity between images and text. It can struggle with tasks that require detailed description, counting, or reading small text unless combined with additional components.\n",
    "- **Where CLIP is better**: high-throughput **retrieval**, open-vocabulary tagging, duplicate detection, and “find similar” search. It is often simpler, faster, and easier to deploy at scale (precompute image embeddings; do fast nearest-neighbor lookups).\n",
    "- **How to extend CLIP without switching models**: prompt engineering; add a small classifier head; fine-tune (or use adapters) on domain data; combine CLIP retrieval with a language model that generates answers from retrieved, curated text (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BLIP trade-offs (generation vs. classification-only)**: BLIP can produce natural-language captions and support VQA, which is great for accessibility and descriptive tasks, but generation is typically slower and more compute-heavy, and it can hallucinate details.\n",
    "- **When CLIP’s simpler approach is preferable**: when you need low latency, high volume, predictable behavior, and ranking/retrieval is the core requirement.\n",
    "- **Compute comparison**: BLIP-style generation generally requires more GPU time per request than CLIP embedding + similarity, especially for multi-token outputs.\n",

    "2) **Most exciting applications**: accessibility assistants, education/tutoring with visual context, robotics/embodied agents, scientific/medical decision support (as assistive tools), and safer content moderation.\n",
    "3) **Biggest concerns**: surveillance and privacy abuse, unfair bias in high-stakes decisions, misinformation/over-trust due to fluent outputs, and the environmental cost of large-scale deployment.\n",
    "4) **Research focus**: grounding + uncertainty estimation, strong evaluation benchmarks that reflect real-world failure modes, privacy-preserving training/inference, and efficiency (distillation, sparse/quantized models) to reduce compute while maintaining quality.\n",

    "3. How would you design \"human-in-the-loop\" systems for high-stakes decisions?\n",
    "4. What training or guidelines would you give to people working with VLM outputs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:\n",
    "1) The distinction matters because VLM outputs are not guaranteed to be correct; treating a model as an autonomous decision-maker invites automation bias, unaccountable harm, and unsafe deployment in high-stakes contexts.\n",
    "2) Examples that should not be autonomous: (a) medical diagnosis/treatment decisions, (b) legal judgments or eligibility determinations (benefits, immigration), (c) hiring/disciplinary decisions or policing/surveillance actions.\n",
    "3) Human-in-the-loop design: use the model for **triage and suggestions**, require source grounding, surface uncertainty, log outputs for audit, and mandate qualified human review/approval before any rights-impacting action. Provide an escalation path and allow the model to abstain.\n",
    "4) Training/guidelines for operators: treat outputs as hypotheses; verify with trusted sources; document decisions; understand known failure modes (hallucination, bias); never rely on model confidence alone; and follow privacy/security procedures for handling images.\n",
